# What is this?
This is a guide to everything you need to pass the Romanian Baccalaureate for Computer Science and get admitted at the University of Computer Science.

# Why did I create this?
It serves as a learning resource for both myself and others. As I study I can share my knowledge through this ebook-like format where I reference the various websites I used to study/remember things I had previously known.
