# Variables, Constants & Expressions
Variables are containers for storing data values.

* The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
* A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable affects that memory location.
* In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.

## Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable, specify the type, its name and optionally assign it a value:
```C
// Declaring a single variable with a certain value
type variable_name = value;

// Declaring a single variable
type variable1_name;

// Declaring multiple variables:
type variable1_name, variable2_name, variable3_name;
```
A variable name can consist of alphabetical letters (both upper and lower case), numbers and the underscore ‘_’ character. However, the name must not start with a number.

Type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable

## Data Types

All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared. Every data type requires a different amount of memory.

```C
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number without decimals)
double myFloatNum = 5.99;    // Floating point number (with decimals)
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
string myText = "Hello";     // String (text)
bool myBoolean = true;       // Boolean (true or false)
```

**Data types in C++ are mainly divided into three types:**

1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 

* Integer
* Character
* Boolean
* Floating Point
* Double Floating Point
* Valueless or Void
* Wide Character

2. Derived Data Types: The data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 

* Function
* Array
* Pointer
* Reference

3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: These data types are defined by the user itself. Like, as defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes: 

* Class
* Structure
* Union
* Enumeration
* Typedef defined DataType

Basic/Primitive Data Types

The data type specifies the size and type of information the variable will store:

| Data Type | Size | Description | Range |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | --- |
| boolean | 1 byte | Stores true or false values | 
| char | 1 byte | Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values |  -128 to 127 or 0 to 255 |
| int | 2 or 4 bytes | Stores whole numbers, without decimals | -2147483648 to 2147483647 |
| float | 4 bytes | Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 7 decimal digits |
| double | 8 bytes | Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits |
| void |  | A void data type is used for those function which does not return a value.  |
| wchar_t | 2 or 4 bytes | Wide character data type is also a character data type but this data type has a size greater than the normal 8-bit datatype. |

### Datatype Modifiers

As the name implies, datatype modifiers are used with the built-in data types to modify the length of data that a particular data type can hold. 

Data type modifiers available in C++ are: 

* Signed
* Unsigned
* Short
* Long

| Data Type | Size | Range |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| short int | 2 bytes | -32,768 to 32,767
| unsigned short int | 2 bytes | 0 to 65,535 |
| unsigned int | 4 bytes | 0 to 4,294,967,295 |
| int | 2 or 4 bytes | (4 byte version) -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long int | 4 bytes | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| unsigned long int | 4 bytes | 0 to 4,294,967,295 |
| long long int | 8 bytes | -(2^63) to (2^63)-1 |
| unsigned long long int | 8 bytes | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |
| signed char | 1 byte | -128 to 127 |
| unsigned char | 1 byte | 0 to 255 |
| float | 4 bytes | |
| double | 8 bytes | |
| long double | 12 bytes | |
| wchar_t | 2 or 4 bytes | 1 wide character |

**Note:** Above values may vary from compiler to compiler. In the above example, we have considered GCC 32 bit.
We can display the size of all the data types by using the sizeof() operator and passing the keyword of the datatype as an argument to this function as shown below: 

**Note:** syntax<limits.h> header file is defined to find the range of fundamental data-types. Unsigned modifiers have minimum value is zero. So, no macro constants are defined for the unsigned minimum value.

C++ Program to Find the Range of Data Types using Macro Constants

```C
// C++ program to sizes of data types
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "Size of char : " << sizeof(char) << " byte"
		<< endl;
cout << "char minimum value: " << CHAR_MIN << endl;

cout << "char maximum value: " << CHAR_MAX << endl;


	cout << "Size of int : " << sizeof(int) << " bytes"
		<< endl;
	cout << "Size of short int : " << sizeof(short int)
		<< " bytes" << endl;
	cout << "Size of long int : " << sizeof(long int)
		<< " bytes" << endl;
	cout << "Size of signed long int : "
		<< sizeof(signed long int) << " bytes" << endl;
	cout << "Size of unsigned long int : "
		<< sizeof(unsigned long int) << " bytes" << endl;
	cout << "Size of float : " << sizeof(float) << " bytes"
		<< endl;
	cout << "Size of double : " << sizeof(double)
		<< " bytes" << endl;
	cout << "Size of wchar_t : " << sizeof(wchar_t)
		<< " bytes" << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

## Difference between variable declaration and definition

The variable declaration refers to the part where a variable is first declared or introduced before its first use. A variable definition is a part wherethe variable is assigned a memory location and a value. Most of the time, variable declaration and definition are done together.
See the following C++ program for better clarification:
```C
// C++ program to show difference b/w definition and declaration of a variable

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	// this is declaration of variable a
	int a;
	// this is initialisation of a
	a = 10;
	// this is definition = declaration + initialisation
	int b = 20;

	// declaration and definition
	// of variable 'a123'
	char a123 = 'a';

	// This is also both declaration and definition
	// as 'b' is allocated memory and
	// assigned some garbage value.
	float c;

	// multiple declarations and definitions
	int _c, _d45, e;

	// Let us print a variable
	cout << a123 << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

## Types of variables

There are three types of variables based on the scope of variables in C++: 
* Local Variables
* Instance Variables
* Static Variables


1. Local Variables: A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable. 
* These variables are created when the block in entered or the function is called and destroyed after exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function. 
* The scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access this variable only within that block.
* Initialization of Local Variable is Mandatory.
    
2. Instance Variables: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor or block. 
* As instance variables are declared in a class, these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
* Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. If we do not specify any access specifier then the default access specifier will be used.
* Initialization of Instance Variable is not Mandatory.
* Instance Variable can be accessed only by creating objects.

3. Static Variables: Static variables are also known as Class variables. 
* These variables are declared similarly as instance variables, the difference is that static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.
* Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.
* Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.
* Initialization of Static Variable is not Mandatory. Its default value is 0
* If we access the static variable like the Instance variable (through an object), the compiler will show the warning message and it won’t halt the program. The compiler will replace the object name with the class name automatically.
* If we access the static variable without the class name, the Compiler will automatically append the class name.

### Instance variable Vs Static variable
* Each object will have its own copy of the instance variable whereas We can only have one copy of a static variable per class irrespective of how many objects we create.
* Changes made in an instance variable using one object will not be reflected in other objects as each object has its own copy of the instance variable. In the case of static, changes will be reflected in other objects as static variables are common to all object of a class.
* We can access instance variables through object references and Static Variables can be accessed directly using the class name.
* Syntax for static and instance variables:
```C
class Example
{
    static int a; // static variable
    int b;        // instance variable
}
```

# Identifiers
All C++ **variables** must be **identified** with **unique names**.

These unique names are called **identifiers**.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

**Note:** It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

```C
// Good
int minutesPerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
int m = 60;
```

The general rules for naming variables are:

* Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
* Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
* Names are case sensitive myVar and myvar are different variables)
* Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
* Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names

# Display Variables

The cout object is used together with the << operator to display variables.

To combine both text and a variable, separate them with the << operator:

```C
int myAge = 35;
cout << "I am " << myAge << " years old."; 
```

# User Input
You have already learned that cout is used to output (print) values. Now we will use cin to get user input.

cin is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator (>>).

In the following example, the user can input a number, which is stored in the variable x. Then we print the value of x:

```C
int x; 
cout << "Type a number: "; // Type a number and press enter
cin >> x; // Get user input from the keyboard
cout << "Your number is: " << x; // Display the input value 
```

# Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

```C
int x = 100 + 50;
```

Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:

```C
int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
```

C++ divides the operators into thefollowing groups:

* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Logical operators
* Bitwise operators

## Arithmetic operators

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | --- |
| + | Addition | Adds together two values | x + y |
| - | Subtraction | Subtracts one value from another | x - y |
| * | Multiplication | Multiplies two values | x * y |
| / | Division | Divides one value by another | x / y |
| % | Modulus | Returns the division remainder | x % y |
| ++ | Increment | Increases the value of a variable by 1 | ++x |
| -- | Decrement | Decreases the value of a variable by 1 | --x |

## Assignment operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

In the example below, we use the assignment operator (=) to assign the value 10 to a variable called x:
```C
int x = 10;
```

The **addition assignment** operator (+=) adds a value to a variable:

```C
int x = 10;
x += 5;
```

A list of assignment operators:

| Operator | Example | Same As |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| = | x = 5 | x = 5 |
| += | x += 3 | x = x + 3 |
| -= | x -= 3 | x = x - 3 |
| *= | x *= 3 | x = x * 3 |
| /= | x /= 3 | x = x / 3 |
| %= | x %= 3 | x = x % 3 |
| &= | x &= 3 | x = & 3 |
| \|= | x \|= 3 | x = x \| 3 |
| ^= | x ^= 3 | x = x ^ 3 |
| >>= | x >>= 3 | x = x >> 3 |
| <<= | x <<= 3 | x = x << 3 |

## Comparison operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

**Note:** The return value of a comparison is either true (1) or false (0).

In the following example, we use the **greater than** operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

```C
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
cout << (x > y); // returns 1 (true) because 5 is greater than 3
```

| Operator | Name | Example |
| --- | ----------- | --- |
| == | Equal to | x == y |
| != | Not equal | x != y |
| > | Greater than | x > y |
| < | Less than | x < y |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | x >= y |
| <= | Less than or equal to | x <= y |

## Logical operators

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | --- |
| && | Logical and | Returns true if both statements are true | x < 5 && x < 10 |
| \|\| | Logical or | Returns true if one of the statements is true | x < 5 \|\| x < 4 |
| ! | Logical not | Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true | !(x < 5 && x < 10)

## Bitwise operators

| Operator | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | --- |
| & | Bitwise AND | Takes 2 numbers and does AND on every bit of the numbers. Returns 1 only if both bits are 1 | (x & y) |
| \| | Bitwise OR | Takes 2 numbers and does OR on every bit of two numbers. Returns 1 if any of the two bits is 1 | ( x \| y ) |
| ^ | Bitwise XOR | Takes 2 numbers and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. Returns 1 if the 2 bits are different. | ( x ^ y ) |
| << | Bitshift left | Takes 2 numbers, left shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift. Mathematically ( x * 2^y ) | ( x << y ) 
| >> | Bitshift right | Takes 2 numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift. Mathematically ( x / 2^y ) | ( x >> y )
| ~ | Bitwise NOT | Takes one number and inverts all the bits of it | ( ~x ) |

Interesting facts about bitwise operators

1. **The left shift and right shift operators should not be used for negative numbers.** If the second operand(which decides the number of shifts) is a negative number, it results in undefined behaviour in C. For example results of both 1 <<- 1 and 1 >> -1 is undefined. Also, if the number is shifted more than the size of the integer, the behaviour is undefined. For example, 1 << 33 is undefined if integers are stored using 32 bits. Another thing is, NO shift operation is performed if additive-expression(operand that decides no of shifts) is 0. See [this](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/INT34-C.+Do+not+shift+an+expression+by+a+negative+number+of+bits+or+by+greater+than+or+equal+to+the+number+of+bits+that+exist+in+the+operand) for more details. 
**Note: In C++, this behavior is well-defined.**
2. **Interestingly!! The bitwise OR of two numbers is just the sum of those two numbers if there is no carry involved, otherwise you just add their bitwise AND.** Let’s say, we have a=5(101) and b=2(010), since there is no carry involved, their sum is just a|b. Now, if we change ‘a’ to 6 which is 110 in binary, their sum would change to a|b + a&b since there is a carry involved. 
3. **The bitwise XOR operator is the most useful operator from a technical interview perspective.** It is used in many problems. A simple example could be “Given a set of numbers where all elements occur an even number of times except one number, find the odd occurring number” This problem can be efficiently solved by just doing XOR to all numbers. 

Solution:
```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to return the only odd
// occurring element
int findOdd(int arr[], int n)
{
	int res = 0, i;
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
		res ^= arr[i];
	return res;
}

// Driver Method
int main(void)
{
	int arr[] = { 12, 12, 14, 90, 14, 14, 14 };
	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	cout << "The odd occurring element is "<< findOdd(arr, n);
	return 0;
}

```

**The bitwise operators should not be used in place of logical operators.** The result of logical operators (&&, || and !) is either 0 or 1, but bitwise operators return an integer value. Also, the logical operators consider any non-zero operand as 1. For example, consider the following program, the results of & and && are different for same operands. 

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int x = 2, y = 5;
	(x & y) ? cout <<"True " : cout <<"False ";
	(x && y) ? cout <<"True " : cout <<"False ";
	return 0;
}

// This code is contributed by shivanisinghss2110
```

**The left-shift and right-shift operators are equivalent to multiplication and division by 2 respectively.** As mentioned in point 1, it works only if numbers are positive. 

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

	int x = 19;
	cout<<"x << 1 = "<< (x << 1) <<endl;
	cout<<"x >> 1 = "<< (x >> 1) <<endl;
	return 0;
}

// This code is contributed by sathiyamoorthics19
```

The & operator can be used to quickly check if a number is odd or even. The value of expression (x & 1) would be non-zero only if x is odd, otherwise the value would be zero. 

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

	int x = 19 ;
	(x & 1) ? cout<<"Odd" : cout<< "Even" ;
	
	return 0;
}

// This code is contributed by sathiyamoorthics19
```

The ~ operator should be used carefully. The result of ~ operator on a small number can be a big number if the result is stored in an unsigned variable. And the result may be a negative number if the result is stored in a signed variable (assuming that the negative numbers are stored in 2’s complement form where the leftmost bit is the sign bit) 

```C
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

	unsigned int x = 1;
	signed int a = 1;
	cout<<"Signed Result "<< ~a <<endl ;
	cout<<"Unsigned Result "<< ~x ;
	return 0;
}
// This code is contributed by sathiyamoorthics19
```



# Constants

When you do not want others (or yourself) to override existing variable values, use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means **unchangeable and read-only**):

```C
const int myNum = 15;  // myNum will always be 15
myNum = 10;  // error: assignment of read-only variable 'myNum' 
```

You should always declare the variable as constant when you have values that are unlikely to change:

```C
const int minutesPerHour = 60;
const float PI = 3.14; 
```

# Expressions

C++ expressions consist of operators, constants, and variables which are arranged according to the rules of the language. It can also contain function calls which return values. An expression can consist of one or more operands, zero or more operators to compute a value. Every expression produces some value which is assigned to the variable with the help of an assignment operator. 

```C
(a+b) - c  
(x/y) -z  
4a2 - 5b +c  
(a+b) * (x+y)  
```

**An expression can be of following types:**

* Constant expressions
* Integral expressions
* Float expressions
* Pointer expressions
* Relational expressions
* Logical expressions
* Bitwise expressions
* Special assignment expressions

If the expression is a combination of the above expressions, such expressions are known as compound expressions.

### Constant expressions

A constant expression is an expression that consists of only constant values. It is an expression whose value is determined at the compile-time but evaluated at the run-time. It can be composed of integer, character, floating-point, and enumeration constants.

Constants are used in the following situations:

* It is used in the subscript declarator to describe the array bound.
* It is used after the case keyword in the switch statement.
* It is used as a numeric value in an enum
* It specifies a bit-field width.
* It is used in the pre-processor #if

In the above scenarios, the constant expression can have integer, character, and enumeration constants. We can use the static and extern keyword with the constants to define the function-scope.

The following table shows the expression containing constant value:

| Expression containing constant | Constant value  |
| --- | --- |
| x = (2/3) * 4 | (2/3) * 4 |
| extern int y = 67 | 67 |
| int z = 43 | 43 |
| static int a = 56 | 56 |

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    int x;        // variable declaration.  
    x=(3/2) + 2;  // constant expression  
    cout<<"Value of x is : "<<x;  // displaying the value of x.  
    return 0;  
}  
```

In the above code, we have first declared the 'x' variable of integer type. After declaration, we assign the simple constant expression to the 'x' variable.

### Integral Expressions

An integer expression is an expression that produces the integer value as output after performing all the explicit and implicit conversions.

**Following are the examples of integral expression:**

```C
(x * y) -5        
x + int(9.0)  
where x and y are the integers.  
```

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    int x;  // variable declaration.  
    int y;  // variable declaration  
    int z;  // variable declaration  
    cout<<"Enter the values of x and y";  
    cin>>x>>y;  
    z=x+y;  
    cout<<"\n"<<"Value of z is :"<<z; //  displaying the value of z.  
    return 0;  
}  
```

In the above code, we have declared three variables, i.e., x, y, and z. After declaration, we take the user input for the values of 'x' and 'y'. Then, we add the values of 'x' and 'y' and stores their result in 'z' variable.

I think you get the idea by now.

### Float Expressions

A float expression is an expression that produces floating-point value as output after performing all the explicit and implicit conversions.

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
          
    float x=8.9;      // variable initialization  
    float y=5.6;      // variable initialization  
    float z;             // variable declaration  
    z=x+y;  
    std::cout <<"value of z is :"  << z<<std::endl;  // displaying the value of z.  
         
      
    return 0;  
}  
```

### Pointer Expressions

A pointer expression is an expression that produces address value as an output.

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
          
    int a[]={1,2,3,4,5};  // array initialization  
    int *ptr;       // pointer declaration  
    ptr=a;    // assigning base address of array to the pointer ptr  
    ptr=ptr+1;   // incrementing the value of pointer  
    std::cout <<"value of second element of an array : "  << *ptr<<std::endl;  
   return 0;  
}  
```

### Relational Expressions

A relational expression is an expression that produces a value of type bool, which can be either true or false. It is also known as a boolean expression. When arithmetic expressions are used on both sides of the relational operator, arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then their results are compared.

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    int a=45;    // variable declaration  
    int b=78;    // variable declaration  
    bool y=a>b;   // relational expression  
    cout<<"Value of y is :"<<y;  // displaying the value of y.  
    return 0;  
}  
```

### Logical Expressions

A logical expression is an expression that combines two or more relational expressions and produces a bool type value. The logical operators are '&&' and '||' that combines two or more relational expressions.

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
	int a=2;  
	int b=7;  
	int c=4;  
	cout<<((a>b)||(a>c));  
	return 0;  
}  
```

### Bitwise Expressions

A bitwise expression is an expression which is used to manipulate the data at a bit level. They are basically used to shift the bits.

For example:

x=3

x>>3 // This statement means that we are shifting the three-bit position to the right.

In the above example, the value of 'x' is 3 and its binary value is 0011. We are shifting the value of 'x' by three-bit position to the right. Let's understand through the diagrammatic representation.

![](/img/cpp-expression2.png)

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    int x=5;   // variable declaration  
    std::cout << (x>>1) << std::endl;  
    return 0;  
}  
```

### Special Assignment Expressions

Special assignment expressions are the expressions which can be further classified depending upon the value assigned to the variable.

* **Chained Assignment**

Chained assignment expression is an expression in which the same value is assigned to more than one variable by using single statement.

```
a=b=20   
or   
(a=b) = 20
```

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()   
	int a;   // variable declaration  
	int b;   // variable declaration  
	a=b=80;  // chained assignment  
	std::cout <<"Values of 'a' and 'b' are : " <<a<<","<<b<< std::endl;  
	return 0;  
}
```
Output:
```
Values of 'a' and 'b' are : 80,80  
```

>**Note:** Using chained assignment expression, the value cannot be assigned to the variable at the time of declaration. For example, int a=b=c=90 is an invalid statement.

* **Embedded Assignment Expression**

An embedded assignment expression is an assignment expression in which assignment expression is enclosed within another assignment expression.

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    int a;  // variable declaration  
    int b;  // variable declaration  
    a=10+(b=90);  // embedded assignment expression  
    std::cout <<"Values of 'a' is " <<a<< std::endl;  
    return 0;  
}  
```
In the above code, we have declared two variables, i.e., 'a' and 'b'. Then, we applied embedded assignment expression (a=10+(b=90)).

Output:
```
Values of 'a' is 100  
```

* Compound Assignment

A compound assignment expression is an expression which is a combination of an assignment operator and binary operator.

```C
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
    int a=10;   // variable declaration  
    a+=10;    // compound assignment  
    std::cout << "Value of a is :" <<a<< std::endl; // displaying the value of a.  
    return 0;  
}
```

Output:
```
Value of a is :20  
```
