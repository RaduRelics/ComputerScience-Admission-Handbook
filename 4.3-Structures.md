# Structures (struct)

Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure. [1][1]

Unlike an [array](/4.2-Character-Arrays.md), a structure can contain many different data types (int, string, bool, etc.). [1][1]

## Create a Structure

To create a structure, use the `struct` keyword and declare each of its members inside curly braces. [1][1]

After the declaration, specify the name of the structure variable (myStructure in the example below): [1][1]

```C
struct {             // Structure declaration
  int myNum;         // Member (int variable)
  string myString;   // Member (string variable)
} myStructure;       // Structure variable
```

## Access Structure Members

To access members of a structure, use the dot syntax (`.`): [1][1]

> ## Example
> Assign data to members of a structure and print it:
> ```C
> // Create a structure variable called > myStructure
> struct {
>  int myNum;
>  string myString;
>} myStructure;
>
>// Assign values to members of >myStructure
>myStructure.myNum = 1;
>myStructure.myString = "Hello World!";
>
>// Print members of myStructure
>cout << myStructure.myNum << "\n";
>cout << myStructure.myString << "\n";
>```

## One Structure in Multiple Variables

You can use a comma (`,`) to use one structure in many variables:

```C
struct {
  int myNum;
  string myString;
} myStruct1, myStruct2, myStruct3; // Multiple structure variables separated with commas 
```

This example shows how to use a structure in two different variables: [1][1]

```C
struct {
  string brand;
  string model;
  int year;
} myCar1, myCar2; // We can add variables by separating them with a comma here

// Put data into the first structure
myCar1.brand = "BMW";
myCar1.model = "X5";
myCar1.year = 1999;

// Put data into the second structure
myCar2.brand = "Ford";
myCar2.model = "Mustang";
myCar2.year = 1969;

// Print the structure members
cout << myCar1.brand << " " << myCar1.model << " " << myCar1.year << "\n";
cout << myCar2.brand << " " << myCar2.model << " " << myCar2.year << "\n";
```

## Named Structures

By giving a name to the structure, you can treat it as a data type. This means that you can create variables with this structure anywhere in the program at any time. [1][1]

To create a named structure, put the name of the structure right after the `struct` keyword: [1][1]

```C
 struct myDataType { // This structure is named "myDataType"
  int myNum;
  string myString;
};
```

To declare a variable that uses the structure, use the name of the structure as the data type of the variable: [1][1]

```C
myDataType myVar;
```
