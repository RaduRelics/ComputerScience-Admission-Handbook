# Character Arrays

A string/character array is a sequence of characters that are treated as a single data item and terminated by a null character `'\0'`. Remember that the C language does not support strings as a data type. A string is actually a one-dimensional array of characters in C language. These are often used to create meaningful and readable programs. [\[1\]][1]

For example: The string "home" contains 5 characters including the '\0' character which is automatically added by the compiler at the end of the string. [\[1\]][1]

> **Note:** In the article you may see me using the term string, it refers to character arrays, also known as c-type strings, not the string from the `<string>` library.

## Declaring and Initializing a character array:

```C++
// valid
char name[13] = "StudyTonight";        
char name[10] = {'c','o','d','e','\0'};      

// Illegal
char ch[3] = "hello";    
char str[4];
str = "hello";  
```

## String Input and Output:

You may encounter c-type i/o (input and output) functions such as `scanf` and `printf`. I will not cover them in detail as the exam usually provides alternatives that use C++ style i/o but here are some useful notions:

* The %s format specifier to read a string input from the terminal. `scanf("%s", &string);`

* But `scanf()`, terminates its input on the first white space it encounters.

* The edit set conversion code `%[..]` can be used to read a line containing a variety of characters, including white spaces.

* The `gets()` function can also be used to read strings with white spaces

```C
char str[20];
printf("Enter a string");
scanf("%[^\n]", &str); 
printf("%s", str);
```

```C
char text[20];
gets(text);
printf("%s", text);
```

But this is C-style code. In C++ we could do this: (the examples are equivalent and share the same issues)

```C++
char text[20];
cout<< "Enter a string\n";
cin>>text; // cin only reads text without whitespaces
cout<<text;
```

```C++
char text[20];
cin.get(text, 20); // this allows reading of whitespaces but the size needs to be specified
cout<<text;
```

```C++
char text[20];
cin.getline(text, 20, "\n"); // this allows reading of whitespaces and stops the delimitation character "\n", but any character can be set instead
cout<<text;
```

## String Handling Functions:

Those were covered in the [STL Functions Chapter](/3.2-STL-Functions.md) under the `<cstring>` library.
