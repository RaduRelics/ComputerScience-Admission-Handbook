# What is this?
This is a guide to everything you need to pass the Romanian Baccalaureate for Computer Science and get admitted at the University of Computer Science.

# Why did I create this?
It serves as a learning resource for both myself and others. As I study I can share my knowledge through this ebook-like format where I reference the various websites I used to study/remember things I had previously known.

# Why is it in English?
I believe certain concepts in this handbook are universal and writing it in Romanian would make it less accessible. The university also has courses which can be taken exclusively in English so familiarizing with the English terms is essential. Besides, English just comes more natural to me.
