# Conditional Statements, While, For

C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

* Less than: a < b
* Less than or equal to: a <= b
* Greater than: a > b
* Greater than or equal to: a >= b
* Equal to a == b
* Not Equal to: a != b

You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

C++ has the following conditional statements:

* Use ``if`` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
* Use ``else`` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
* Use ``else if`` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
* Use ``switch`` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

## The if Statement

```C
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

>Note that ``if`` is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate an error.

In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is ``true``, print some text:

```C
if (20 > 18) {
  cout << "20 is greater than 18";
} 
```

We can also test variables:

```C
int x = 20;
int y = 18;
if (x > y) {
  cout << "x is greater than y";
} 
```

## The else Statement

Use the ``else`` statement to specify a block of code to be executed ``if`` the condition is ``false``.

```C
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

```C
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
  cout << "Good day.";
} else {
  cout << "Good evening.";
}
// Outputs "Good evening." 
```

## The else if Statement
Use the ``else if`` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is ``false``.

```C
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```

```C
int time = 22;
if (time < 10) {
  cout << "Good morning.";
} else if (time < 20) {
  cout << "Good day.";
} else {
  cout << "Good evening.";
}
// Outputs "Good evening." 
```

## Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)

There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the **ternary operator** because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:

``
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
``

Instead of writing:

```C
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
  cout << "Good day.";
} else {
  cout << "Good evening.";
} 
```

You can simply write:

```C
int time = 20;
string result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";
cout << result; 
```

## Switch Statements

Use the ``switch`` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

```C
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}
```

This is how it works:

* The switch expression is evaluated once
* The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case
* If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
* The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter

The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

```C
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    cout << "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    cout << "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    cout << "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    cout << "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    cout << "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    cout << "Saturday";
    break;
  case 7:
    cout << "Sunday";
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4) 
```

### The break Keyword

When C++ reaches a ``break`` keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.

> A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.

### The default Keyword

The ``default`` keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match:

```C
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 6:
    cout << "Today is Saturday";
    break;
  case 7:
    cout << "Today is Sunday";
    break;
  default:
    cout << "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
// Outputs "Looking forward to the Weekend" 
```

> **Note:** The default keyword must be used as the last statement in the switch, and it does not need a break.

## While Loop

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

The ``while`` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is ``true``:

```C
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:

```C
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;
}
```

> **Note:** Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!

The ``do/while`` loop is a variant of the ``while`` loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

```C
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```

The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

```C
int i = 0;
do {
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);
```

> Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!

## For Loop

When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the ``for`` loop instead of a ``while`` loop:

```C
 for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

**Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

**Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

**Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:

```C
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  cout << i << "\n";
}
```

Example explained

* Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (int i = 0).

* Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5). If the condition is true, the loop will start over again, if it is false, the loop will end.

* Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

This example will only print even values between 0 and 10:

```C
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {
  cout << i << "\n";
}
```

## Break and Continue

### Break
You have already seen the ``break`` statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" of a ``switch`` statement.

The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.

This example jumps out of the loop when i is equal to 4:

```C
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
  cout << i << "\n";
} 
```

### Continue

The ``continue`` statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

This example skips the value of 4:

```C
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    continue;
  }
  cout << i << "\n";
} 
```

You can also use ``break`` and ``continue`` in while loops:

```C
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
} 
```

```C
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  if (i == 4) {
    i++;
    continue;
  }
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;
} 
```
